## Profile
I am an entry level full-stack Javascript web developer, with a strong sense of attention to detail and a great work ethic. Working with computers and software is my passion.

Satisfaction is gained for me with a sense of pride in knowing that I have created a piece of software that is useful for people to make their lives a little easier and saves them time, that is why I chose to become a programmer.

I enjoy working in a team and have experience both with leading a team and being apart of a team in my previous job experiences.

## Development Experience

### Plan Better
#### [https://github.com/planit-better](https://github.com/planit-better)
##### June 2017

Plan Better is a web application that helps people better plan and coordinate events, by providing tools and graphs to help making the event planning process easier and less time consuming. There are some neat functions incorporated into our app that let the user send mass invitations via email or text, with one push of a button!

I handled the majority of the front-end design and made sure every page layout was consistent, including capitalization, button color, and lettering. I also researched yelp api and email api, and incorporated the email function into our application.


### Kanban Board
#### [https://github.com/Dru808/React-Kanban](https://github.com/Dru808/React-Kanban)
##### May 2017

The Kanban Board was an assignment given out by the instructors at Dev League. After hours of lecture, we were to create a Kanban Board that is able to add tasks to a card and assign them either a status of "to do", "in-progress", or "done".
