## Development Experience

### Plan Better
#### [https://github.com/planit-better](https://github.com/planit-better)
##### June 2017

Plan Better is a web application that helps people plan and coordinate events better by providing tools and graphs to help making the planning process of an event much easier and much less time consuming. There are some neat functions incorporated into our app that lets the user send mass invitations via email or texts with one push of a button!

As a team-member on the Plan Better project, I tried to pitch in where I can. Mainly I helped with the majority of the front-end design and made sure every single page is consistent with the layouts of the other pages. I made sure that every capitalization, every button color,  every lettering is consistant.

I also helped do research on yelp api and and email api and incorporated the email function into our application.

The outcomes for this project was a sucess! Even though we didn't get our web application to deploy due to time constraints, we as a team learned a lot about team communications and time management.
